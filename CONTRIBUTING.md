# Contribution Guidelines

Usually you'd find a single **master** / **main** branch for a repository.
This repository for the tutorial is exceptional, because there are 2 **completely separate** branches:

* First one (where this contribution guideline is located) contains contents for the tutorial,
* Second one contains source code for the tutorial and has a linear git history.
