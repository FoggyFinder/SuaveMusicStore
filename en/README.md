# Introduction

This is a tutorial on how to create an application with [F#](http://fsharp.org) and [Suave.IO](http://suave.io) framework. 
It's inspired by the Music Store tutorial created by the ASP.NET team [available here](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1).
Check out this link if you want to find out what the application is going to offer.

Target audience for this tutorial are developers who want to learn how to write a web application in F#.
For those with C# and ASP.NET background there will be a couple of comparisons as well.
You can still benefit from the tutorial if you don't have C# / .NET background, however a few parts may sound enigmatic.
No prior experience with F# is required - the tutorial will cover basic concepts of the language.
The tutorial is going to have plenty of references to the awesome [fsharpforfunandprofit.com](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com) WebSite, which includes plenty of articles about F# written by Scott Wlaschin.

For most of sections there will be a direct link to a specific commit that contains implementation of the application up to the point.
This allows you to follow along the process of creating the app, and get back on the track in case of any ambiguity.

You're more than welcome to create issues or pull requests for this tutorial.
