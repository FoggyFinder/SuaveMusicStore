# Prerequisites

I did my best to make the tutorial cross platform applicable.
Although tested thoroughly only on Windows, you should be fine working with Linux / MacOS as well.
Be warned that however that for snippets showing CLI commands are adjusted for PowerShell and thus are prompted with `>`.
Adjusting those snippets for *nix terminals should not be a big deal.

Following is a list of required software to work with throughout the tutorial:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - x-plat editor from Microsoft
* [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) - great F# extension for Visual Studio Code
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - container platform, in this tutorial used for hosting a Postgres Database
