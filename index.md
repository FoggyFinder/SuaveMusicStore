Suave Music Store
=================

Introduction
------------

This is a tutorial on how to create an application with [F#](http://fsharp.org) and [Suave.IO](http://suave.io) framework. 
It's inspired by the Music Store tutorial created by the ASP.NET team [available here](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1).
Target audience for this tutorial are mainly C# developers familiar with ASP.NET MVC, who want to learn how to write a real application in F#.
You can still benefit from the tutorial if you don't have C# / .NET background, however you may find some aspects not clear - From time to time there will be a comparison with how the same functionality could be written in ASP.NET MVC & C#.
