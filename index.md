Suave Music Store
=================

Introduction
------------

This is a tutorial on how to create an application with [F#](http://fsharp.org) and [Suave.IO](http://suave.io) framework. 
It's inspired by the Music Store tutorial created by the ASP.NET team [available here](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1).
Target audience for this tutorial are mainly C# developers familiar with ASP.NET MVC, who want to learn how to write a real application in F#.
No prior experience with F# is required - the tutorial will cover primary concepts of the language.
You can still benefit from the tutorial if you don't have C# / .NET background, however you may find some aspects not clear - From time to time there will be a comparison with how the same functionality could be written in ASP.NET MVC & C#.

Visual Studio 2013 is used throughout the tutorial, but of course you can use IDE of your choice.

Hello World from Suave
----------------------

Suave application can be hosted as a standalone Console Application. 
Let's start by creating a Console Application Project named `SuaveMusicStore` (to keep all the files in single folder, uncheck the option to create folder for solution).
Now we can add NuGet reference to Suave. To do that, in Package Manager Console type: `install-package Suave`. 
Alternatively, you can use the NuGet GUI to find and install the Suave package.
Rename the `Program.fs` file to `App.fs` to better reflect the purpose of the file, and replace its contents completely with the following code:


```
open Suave                 // always open suave
open Suave.Http.Successful // for OK-result
open Suave.Web             // for config

startWebServer defaultConfig (OK "Hello World!")
```

Guess what, if you press F5 to run the project, your application is now up and running!
By default it should be available under `http://localhost:8083`.
If you browse that url, you should be greeted with the classic `Hello World!`.
Note there is no `Main` method defined in `App.fs` - what happens here is that the `startWebServer` function is invoked immediately after the program starts and Suave starts listening for incoming request till the process is killed.
